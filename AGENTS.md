# Superapp Monorepo — Agent Rules

## 1. Always verify before declaring success

- After any code change, run the relevant build / type-check / test.
- After any deployment, open the live URL with the browser tool and confirm the UI renders.
- Do not finish a task with "it should work" or "you can check it".

## 2. Git + Vercel workflow

When the user asks to deploy, redeploy, or verify a frontend app:

1. `git status --short` to see local changes.
2. `git add <relevant-files>` and `git commit -m "fix: <description>"`.
3. `git push origin viet`.
4. Use `vercel --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"` to list deployments or trigger a new build.
5. Wait for `READY` state.
6. Use `browser_navigate` to the production URL and `browser_get_content` to verify.

## 3. Environment variables

- `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` are injected via `OH_AGENT_SERVER_ENV`.
- `vercel` and `gh` CLI are available in the agent-server sandbox.
- Never claim "no access to Vercel" or "gh not authenticated" when these tokens are present.

## 4. Debugging discipline

- Do not hide stderr with `2>/dev/null` when investigating failures.
- Capture exact error messages, HTTP status codes, and console logs.
- Retry at most 3 times with the same approach; after that, try a different method.

## 5. Ask for confirmation only when destructive

- Auto-commit and auto-push are fine for small, safe fixes.
- Ask the user before: force-push, database migration, deleting files, or exposing secrets.
